nGrinder 3.2 supports Groovy as a another scripting language. It’s not a just replacement of Jython but also new test script development model. When you decide to write scripts with groovy in maven structure, you can reuse the existing development experiences with JUnit and Eclipse(or IntelliJ).

- [Groovy Script Structure](groovy-script-structure)
- [Groovy Maven Structure](groovy-maven-structure)
- [Install Groovy IDE](install-groovy-ide)
- [Import Groovy Maven Project in IDE](import-groovy-maven-project-in-ide)

Groovy is not only convenient to write but also efficient to execute. Our benchmark result shows that the Groovy script which does same job as Jython script can have 2 times more virtual user count(especially thread count) per agent.
