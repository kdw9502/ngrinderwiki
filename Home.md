**nGrinder** (pronounced as en-g-ra-in-der) is a stress tests platform that enables you to create test scripts, execute tests, monitor target servers and generate results simultaneously. The open-source nGrinder offers easy ways to conduct stress tests by eliminating inconveniences and providing integrated environments. It uses the renowned performance test tool, [The Grinder](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/), as its internal engine.

This is the tool developed by the service provider who really runs frequent load testing not by tool vendor. A breakthrough feature of nGrinder 3.X is support for concurrent tests which means that multiple users can run different tests at the same time! And it's cloud friendly and has attractive interface !

nGrinder is being developed by Naver Business Platform and NHN China together.
